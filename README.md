# libvidcap
libvidcap is a cross-platform library for capturing video from webcams and other video capture devices. 

I'm using this repo on github to add and test some new features and improvements like:

- cmake support (done)
- doxygen documentation (done)
- folder input support
- v4l2 support
- different camera SDK support
- code refactoring and simplification


The original code originates from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libvidcap/
