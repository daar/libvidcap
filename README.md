# libvidcap
libvidcap is a cross-platform library for capturing video from webcams and other video capture devices. The oridignal code originates from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libvidcap/

I'm using this repo on github to add and test some new features like:

- cmake support
- v4l2 support
- camera SDK plugin support
